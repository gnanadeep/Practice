// /***************  Object destructering  ************************/
// 1) var emp = {id: 1234, name: "Rajsekhar" ,address: {city: "Sydney", country: "Aus"}};
//    i) Extract properties : id, name  into local variables from the  above object.
//    ii) Write code to extract the id, name into local variables such as empId, empName.


// 2) Create local variables which holds the array elements from index positions : 2, 5, 7, 9, 10 
// var arr = ["R", "H", "L", "N", "O", "U", "E", "Q", "D"]

// 3) Write a function which takes paramater emp object and extracts address into the local variable "address" in that function and
// log all the enumerable properties of that address in that function.

// 4) Write a function which takes paramater emp object and extracts address, ame, id, grade, joblevel 
// {assign some default values for all of them if they are not exist}   in that function.
// Construct an emp object locally in that function with the properties extracted into local variables.

// 5) In question no: 2 {assign default values for all of the local variables check which is assigned which default value which one is not}
